# MongoDB, MySQL, Kafka Connect, MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka and R example - Stock example

This demo generates fake stock data and populates two databases - MySQL and MongoDB.  Data flows from these databases to Kafka topics via their respetive connectors - Debezium MySQL and MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka.  Data from both topics are  then sinked to a MongoDB cluster in MongoDB Atlas using the MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka as a sink.  With the combined data in Atlas we connect using an R client like RStudio to query the data for a moving average and other queries.

## Requirements
  - Docker 18.09+
  - Docker compose 1.24+
  - [Kafkacat](https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat) (optional)
  - RStudio (Optional)
  - Mongolite R driver (optional)

## Running the demo
### 1. Download/Clone the docker files from the GitHub repository

[https://github.com/RWaltersMA/movingaverage.git](https://github.com/RWaltersMA/movingaverage.git)

### 2. Build the demo images

Run the following script from the command shell:

`Build-images.sh`

Note: Make sure you are in the same directory as the build-images script file.  Also, you may have to add execute permission via a `chmod +x build-images.sh` to execute the script.

This shell script will build the following demo containers locally: mysqlimg, stockgenmongo, stockgenmysql, stockportal.  You can confirm these four images were created by issuing a “docker images” command.

### 3. Copy the Atlas Connection String

If you do not have a MongoDB Atlas cluster, [follow these instructions](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/).

Just creating the cluster is not enough to run the demo.  You will need to define a database user for use by the Kafka Connector to connect to the MongoDB Atlas cluster.  You will also have to whitelist the IP address of the docker host.

If you have not created a database user for the Kafka Connector:

Select, “Database Access” from the Atlas menu and click the “Add new User” button.  

Provide a username and password and select, “Read and write to any database”.  Remember the password.

If your docker host is not whitelisted:
Click, “Network Access” from the Atlas menu and click, “Add IP Address”.  Here you can add your current IP address or any IP Address or block of addresses in CIDR format.  Note: If you do not know or can not obtain the IP address of the docker host you can add, “0.0.0.0” as an entry which will allow connections from anywhere on the internet.  This is not a recommended configuration.

To copy the connection string select the “CONNECT” button on your Atlas cluster then choose “Connect your application”.  Click the Copy button to copy the connection string to the clipboard.</p>

### 4. Execute the RUN.SH script passing Atlas Connection String

The demo is now ready to go just issue a `sh run.sh "<<paste in your Atlas Connection String here>>"` and the script will start the docker containers and configure the connectors.

## Running the Demo

Once the docker images and containers are built and deployed, the demo can be run repeatedly by simply executing the `sh run.sh "<<paste in your Atlas Connection String here>>"`

### 1. View the generated stock entities 

Open a web browser on your docker host and point to http://localhost:8888

The demo will randomly generate 10 securities, 5 for MySQL and 5 for MongoDB respectively.  This web page simply connects to MySQL and MongoDB and show the names of the stocks that will be used within the current iteration of the demo.

### 2. View the topic messages

Stockgenmongo and Stockgenmysql containers are running python apps that are pushing stock transactions into their respective databases.  Messages in mysqlstock.Stocks.StockData topic are using the Debezium MySQL connector.  Messages in the stockdata.Stocks.StockData topic came from the MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka.  You can view the messages in these Kafka topics using the Kafkacat tool.  Messages present in these topics validates that our connectors are set up and working.

#### View messages from MySQL in mysqlstock.Stocks.StockData topic
`kafkacat -b 127.0.0.1:9092  -t mysqlstock.Stocks.StockData -s avro -r 127.0.0.1:8081`

...

#### View messages from MongoDB in stockdata.Stocks.StockData topic
`kafkacat -b 127.0.0.1:9092  -t stockdata.Stocks.StockData`

### 4. View the combined data in MongoDB Atlas

The MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka is configured as a sink connector and writes data to MongoDB Atlas.  Data is written to the StockData collection in the Stocks database.  Click on "Collections" tab in your MongoDB Atlas portal to view the StockData collection. These data are from both the MySQL and MongoDB databases.

### 7. Calculate the moving average using R

The R language has many libraies that are useful for analytics.  MongoDB has support for R via the mongolite R driver.  The script "R-Demo-Script.txt" located in this github repository showcases two plots: one that displays a blox plot of all the stock entities showing max and min of each entity, the second shows the moving average for a selected entity.  Note:  Make sure you change the stock ticker symbol to a stock that exists when you run the command to show the moving average.
